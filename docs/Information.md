## Information

- This provides [React PropTypes](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html) for Immutable.js data.
- This is the equivalent of `React.PropTypes.instanceOf(Immutable.Type)` so you can do all the normal stuff
  - `.isRequired`, nest in `.oneOfType`, etc.
- React and Immutable are peer dependencies, so this will not install those for you.
  - This module works with any version of React and Immutable you have installed! üçæ
